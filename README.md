# Project 1: Grouping Spotify genres into similar clusters. 
• I applied the K-means clustering algorithm to group Spotify genres into similar 
clusters based on simplified music features. 

• The objective was to uncover patterns and similarities between different music 
genres and gain insights into the musical characteristics shared within each cluster
