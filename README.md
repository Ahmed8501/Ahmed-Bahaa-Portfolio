📌(**Project 1: Grouping Spotify genres into similar clusters.**)(https://github.com/Ahmed8501/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Clustering_Spotify_Genres.ipynb) 

• Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the music data.

• Visualized data using plots and charts to gain insights into genre patterns.

• Applied the K-means clustering algorithm to group Spotify genres into similar 
clusters based on simplified music features.

• The objective was to uncover patterns and similarities between different music 
genres and gain insights into the musical characteristics shared within each cluster
