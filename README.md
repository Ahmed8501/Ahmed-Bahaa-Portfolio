# [Project 1: Grouping Spotify Genres into Similar Clusters](https://github.com/Ahmed8501/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Clustering_Spotify_Genres.ipynb)

• Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the music data.

• Visualized data using plots and charts to gain insights into genre patterns.

• Applied the K-means clustering algorithm to group Spotify genres into similar 
clusters based on simplified music features.

• The objective was to uncover patterns and similarities between different music 
genres and gain insights into the musical characteristics shared within each cluster

# [Project 2: Decision tree classifier predicting customer churn](https://github.com/Ahmed8501/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Classification_Customer_churn.ipynb)

• Performed Data Cleansing by filling NaN values with the mean, Handling Inconsistent Data, and encoding categorical variables into their numerical format.

• Performed EDA to gain insights into the dataset, such as identifying patterns and correlations.

• Developed a predictive model using a Decision Tree Classifier to predict 
customer churn in the telecommunication industry.

• The objective was to assist businesses in the telecommunication industry to 
identify customers who are most likely to churn to help in minimizing revenue 
loss.

# [Project 3: Linear regression model estimating used cars’ selling price](https://github.com/Ahmed8501/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

• Gathered comprehensive data on used cars, including features like mileage, age, brand, model, and historical selling prices.

• Performed EDA to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset.

• Built a Linear Regression model to establish a relationship between car features and selling prices.

• Evaluated the model performance using metrics like R-Squared (R^2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
